# My Energy Analysis Project (Inspired by Vaclav Smil)

I've been reading Vaclav Smil's books lately and decided to try doing some analysis myself using his approach. I'm no expert like him, but I wanted to apply some of his ideas to understand energy systems better.

## What I'm Trying to Do

I put together some Jupyter notebooks that look at global energy from four different angles. I'm trying to use Smil's super-detailed, numbers-focused approach. As he keeps saying in his books, energy transitions take DECADES not years (politicians never seem to get this!).

## My Notebooks

### 1. Energy Intensity Stuff (2000-2019)
This one looks at how much energy countries need to make $1 of GDP (kWh/$). I was reading Smil's "Energy and Civilization" and wanted to see if I could spot the patterns he talks about.

What I found: Countries that extract resources or have heavy industry use WAY more energy per dollar than service economies. Also noticed what looks like that environmental Kuznets curve thing Smil mentions - countries get less efficient as they develop, then more efficient later.

### 2. How Carbon-Intensive is Electricity? (2000-2020)
After reading Smil's "Power Density" I got interested in how much CO₂ comes from electricity in different places (g CO₂e/kWh). Smil is always talking about the technical challenges of decarbonization, and now I see why!

What I found: Coal-based systems are TERRIBLE (like 8-10x worse than nuclear or hydro). Also, European countries are decarbonizing much faster than others since about 2010.

### 3. Fossil Fuel Use Patterns (1950-2022)
This one's inspired by how Smil always emphasizes SCALE and PHYSICAL QUANTITIES. I looked at who's using the most fossil fuels, both total and per person.

What I found: Just 10 countries use over 70% of all fossil fuels!! And the gulf states use CRAZY amounts per person (like 24-31× global average). Also, China's consumption has gone up 700% since 2000 - just like Smil warns about developing country growth.

### 4. Energy Mix Development Analysis (1970-2022)
My newest analysis looks at how energy sources (coal, oil, gas, nuclear, renewables) have evolved over time globally and in key countries. This directly examines the energy transitions Smil writes so much about.

What I found: Energy transitions really ARE slow (just like Smil says) - most countries only increase renewables by 0.3-0.7 percentage points per year. Also saw how natural gas serves as a "bridge fuel" exactly as Smil describes. Even renewable leaders like Denmark took 20+ years to transform their systems.

## How I Tried to Copy Smil's Approach

I tried to:
- Focus on NUMBERS rather than just making claims
- Think about the physical realities (like Smil always does)
- Look at long-term trends (like decades, not just a few years)
- Consider whole systems rather than cherry-picking facts
- Be skeptical about quick transitions (Smil calls this "energy illiteracy"!)

## My Data

I used Our World in Data's energy dataset, which combines data from:
- BP Statistical Review
- IEA World Energy Balances
- UN Population Division
- Ember electricity data

## Acknowledgment

I'm just an amateur trying to understand this stuff, but Smil's books like "Energy and Civilization," "Power Density," and "Energy Transitions" have changed how I see the world. His insistence on empirical data and skepticism of simplistic narratives is helpful.

As Smil says: "We cannot escape history, we cannot escape the physical laws and constraints of this planet, and we cannot escape the realities of energy conversions." I'm just trying to apply some of that wisdom in my own small way.
