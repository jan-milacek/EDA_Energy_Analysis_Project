# Electricity Carbon Intensity Analysis - My Findings

## What I was studying
I've been looking at carbon intensity of electricity (g CO₂e/kWh) from 2000-2020 across different countries. Smil discusses this topic in his books, and I wanted to see the patterns for myself.

## Key Statistics
1. **World Average**: Global electricity carbon intensity is around 440 g CO₂e/kWh
2. **High Carbon Intensity**: Coal-heavy countries like South Africa, India, and Kazakhstan have high values (700-1000 g CO₂e/kWh)
3. **Low Carbon Intensity**: Norway, Sweden, and France have low values (only 25-100 g CO₂e/kWh) thanks to hydro and nuclear
4. **Gradual Progress**: Global electricity has only gotten 10-15% cleaner in a decade (which supports Smil's observations about transition speeds)

## Major Trends I Noticed

### 1. Energy Mix Is Determinative
- **Coal-based systems**: South Africa, India, Australia have the highest carbon intensity
- **Natural gas systems**: US, UK, Italy are in the middle (about half the intensity of coal)
- **Nuclear & hydro systems**: France, Sweden, Switzerland have the lowest carbon intensity
- More renewables correlate with lower carbon intensity (strong negative correlation)

### 2. Different Regions, Different Stories
- **Europe**: Making the MOST progress, especially since 2010
- **Asia**: Got WORSE at first due to China's coal boom, but now stabilizing
- **North America**: Getting better at moderate pace (switching from coal to gas + renewables)
- **Africa**: Still really high carbon intensity and not improving much :(

### 3. Economic Development Patterns
- Developing countries usually get DIRTIER before getting cleaner (exactly like Smil describes!)
- Bigger countries tend to have higher carbon intensity (they use their domestic coal)
- Countries with similar fossil fuel % can have TOTALLY different carbon intensities (coal vs. gas makes huge difference)

### 4. Time Trends
- Decarbonization sped up after the 2015 Paris Agreement (but still way too slow!)
- Economic shocks (like 2008 Financial Crisis) temporarily reduce carbon intensity
- Many countries hit a turning point around 2010, after which carbon intensity started falling

## What This Means for Policy

1. **Coal Reduction Priority**: Replacing coal has the biggest impact on reducing electricity carbon intensity (as Smil points out)
   
2. **Not All Fossil Fuels Are Equal**: The type of fossil fuel matters significantly:
   - Switching coal→gas cuts emissions 50-60% (substantial improvement)
   - But transitioning to low-carbon sources remains necessary for deep decarbonization

3. **Effective Planning**: The cleanest electricity systems use a smart mix:
   - Hydro where available (Smil loves hydro!)
   - Nuclear for baseload (Smil thinks we need more nuclear!)
   - Wind/solar where it makes sense
   - A bit of gas for flexibility

4. **Electrification Isn't Automatically Good**: This is a point Smil makes that people miss:
   - Electric cars + dirty electricity = still dirty!
   - Heat pumps + coal power = not great!
   - Clean up the grid FIRST, then electrify everything

5. **Countries Should Work Together**: Neighboring countries often have WILDLY different carbon intensities:
   - Connect grids across borders!
   - Share technology and policies!
   - Carbon pricing across regions!

## About My Data
- Used Our World in Data's energy dataset:
  - BP Statistical Review
  - IEA World Energy Balances
  - Ember Global Electricity Review
- Focused on 2000-2020 (latest complete data)
- Some countries have missing data
- Main measure: carbon intensity of electricity (g CO₂e/kWh)

Energy transitions are challenging and gradual, as Smil frequently notes. The physics and economics often operate independently of political timelines.
