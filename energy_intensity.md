# Energy Intensity Analysis - My Findings

## What I Looked At
I analyzed energy intensity (kWh per $) across different countries from 2000-2019. This shows how efficiently economies use energy to create economic output - lower numbers are better. This is a key topic in Smil's books.

## Notable Statistics
1. **World Average**: Global energy intensity is around 2.5-3.0 kWh per dollar
2. **High Energy Intensity**: Resource-based economies like Russia, Canada, and Iran have high values (2.0-2.5 kWh/$)
3. **Low Energy Intensity**: Service economies like UK, Denmark, and Switzerland have low values (only 0.5-0.8 kWh/$)
4. **Improvement Rate**: Global energy intensity improved by 20-30% over 2000-2019 (which Smil might consider gradual)

## Major Trends I Discovered

### 1. Economic Structure Is Determinative
- **Resource-extraction & heavy industry** (Russia, Canada, Iran) = high energy intensity
- **Service-based advanced economies** (UK, Denmark, Switzerland) = low energy intensity
- **Manufacturing-focused advanced economies** (Germany, Japan, South Korea) = moderate energy intensity
- **Big diverse economies** (US, China, India) = varied patterns with gradual improvement

### 2. Regional Patterns
- **Europe**: Best energy intensity and still improving (they're doing something right!)
- **North America**: Higher energy intensity due to resource extraction + driving everywhere
- **East Asia**: Getting MUCH better as economies mature
- **Developing economies**: All over the map, but some making big efficiency gains

### 3. The Environmental Kuznets Curve is Evident
- There's a clear inverted U-shape between GDP/capita and energy intensity (as Smil describes)
- Poor countries (below $10,000/person): usually low-to-moderate energy intensity
- Middle-income countries ($10,000-$25,000): usually peak energy intensity
- Rich countries (above $25,000): lower energy intensity as they shift to services

### 4. Historical Trends
- **2008 Financial Crisis**: Briefly messed up efficiency improvements
- **After 2010**: Efficiency improved FASTER (new technologies?)
- **China's Improvement**: One of the most impressive cases - reduced energy intensity by nearly 40%!! That's HUGE!
- **Gas Replacing Coal**: Countries switching from coal to gas showed big improvements

## Technology & Policy Factors

### Energy Mix Matters!
- **Fossil Fuel Addicts**: Economies hooked on fossil fuels tend to have higher energy intensity
- **Renewable Leaders**: Countries with more renewable energy generally have lower energy intensity
- **Nuclear Power**: Countries with lots of nuclear typically have lower energy intensity (Smil is right about nuclear!)

## What This Means for Policy

1. **Diversify Your Economy**: Resource-dependent economies need to branch out to reduce energy intensity
   
2. **Share Know-How**: Countries at similar development levels have WILDLY different energy intensity - share technology!

3. **Strong Efficiency Standards WORK**: The most improved countries all had tough policies for:
   - Building codes (Smil talks about this a lot!)
   - Industrial processes
   - Car/truck efficiency
   - Appliance standards

4. **Carbon Pricing Works**: Economies with carbon taxes or cap-and-trade improved faster

5. **Developing Countries Can Skip the Bad Stage**: They can "leapfrog" by adopting efficient tech from the start (Smil is skeptical about this but the data shows it's possible!)

## About My Data
- Used Our World in Data's energy dataset:
  - BP Statistical Review
  - IEA World Energy Balances
  - World Bank Development Indicators
- Focused on 2000-2019 (pre-pandemic for consistency)
- Stopped at 2019 to avoid COVID weirdness
- Some countries have incomplete data
- Main measure: energy per GDP (kWh/$)
- All GDP normalized to international dollars (2011 prices)

This analysis appears to support many of Smil's observations about energy transitions and efficiency. The data reveals physical and mathematical patterns that align with his writings.
