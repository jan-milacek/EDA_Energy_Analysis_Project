# My Analysis of Fossil Fuel Consumption (2023)

## What I Was Looking At
I've been trying to analyze fossil fuel consumption patterns from 1950-2022 following Smil's approach. He emphasizes long-term trends, population dynamics, and physical quantities rather than percentages, so that's what I focused on.

## Notable Statistics
1. **Consumption Concentration**: The top 10 consuming countries use 70.7% of all fossil fuels but only have 53.8% of world population.
2. **Persian Gulf High Consumption**: Qatar uses 232,000 kWh/person and Kuwait uses 178,000 kWh/person - that's 24-31× more than the global average.
3. **India Uses Relatively Little**: Despite being the 3rd biggest consumer overall, Indians only use 5,800 kWh/person.
4. **China's Significant Growth**: China's consumption has grown ~700% since 2000, which aligns with what Smil discusses in his books.

## Main Trends I Spotted

### 1. Population & Energy Use
- **Population is Super Concentrated**: The top 10 countries have ~65.6% of all people
- **China + India = HUGE**: Together they have ~36% of global population (2.8 BILLION people!)
- **Different Growth Patterns**: China's population is plateauing while India keeps growing at nearly 1% per year
- **Regional Differences**: Asian countries growing fast, Western countries growing mostly through immigration

### 2. Total Consumption Patterns
- **Super Unfair Distribution**: Population share vs. consumption share is WILDLY different
- **US Uses WAY Too Much**: 16.4% of global fossil fuels with only 4.2% of population (3.9× disproportionate!)
- **China's MASSIVE Increase**: 700% growth since 2000 - exactly as Smil predicts with industrialization
- **Shifting East**: Consumption moving from North America/Europe toward Asia (just like Smil describes!)

### 3. Per Person Consumption
- **CRAZY Differences**: India uses 16.3 times LESS per person than the US (5,800 vs 94,500 kWh/person)!
- **Development = More Energy**: Just like Smil says in his books, economic development stage directly relates to energy use
- **Different Paths**: Rich countries (US, Germany, UK) plateauing or declining per capita while developing economies growing fast
- **US Peak**: US hit peak per capita consumption around 2005 (105,000 kWh) and has dropped ~10% since

### 4. Outlier Countries (This is WILD!)
- **Gulf States are OFF THE CHARTS**: Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia use 5-7× more than even rich Western countries!
- **Super Volatile**: These countries' consumption jumps up and down 30-40% between years!
- **Cheap Energy = Waste**: Energy subsidies keep prices super low (below $0.05/kWh) in these places
- **No Upper Limit**: If you take away economic constraints, people just keep using more and more energy (exactly what Smil warns about!)

## What This Means for Policy

1. **Focus on the Big Players**: Policies targeting just 10 countries could address over 70% of global fossil fuel use (efficiency matters!!)
   
2. **China is EVERYTHING**: China's continued growth is both the biggest problem AND opportunity for global decarbonization

3. **Fairness Questions**: The HUGE differences between population share and consumption share raise major equity issues

4. **Efficiency Opportunities**: Some countries at similar GDP levels use WAY different amounts of energy, showing big efficiency potential

5. **Growth Without More Energy**: Advanced economies are proving Smil's point that you can have economic growth without proportional energy increases

6. **Prices Matter**: The outlier countries show how important price signals are (just like Smil always says!)

## About My Data
- Used Our World in Data (OWID) Energy Data Repository:
  - BP Statistical Review
  - IEA World Energy Balances
  - UN Population Division data
- Looked at 1950 to 2022, especially focused on trends since 2000
- Tracked both total consumption (TWh) and per capita rates (kWh/person)

As Smil would say, the numbers don't lie! The physical realities are what they are, regardless of what politicians claim is possible!
